<strong>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong>,in full <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,</strong>,
born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician
who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and <a

    nuclear weapon</a> programme.He was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/president-government-officia" target="blank">president</a>
of India from 2002 to 2007.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined </i>
the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indian-Space-Research-Organisation
    " target="blank">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch
vehicle
that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number
of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first
intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
<br/>
<br/>
From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific
adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998
nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the
tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called
Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed
society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing
technology as a vehicle for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/economic-growth" target="blank">economic growth</a>
, and widening access to health care and education.

    <br/>
    <h1>Career as a scientist</h1><br/>
    After graduating from the <strong>Madras Institute of Technology</strong>in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment
    of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist
    after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small
    hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai,
    the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba
    Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
    where he was the project director of<strong>India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle </strong> (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
    satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO
    in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
    Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
    In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
    Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite
    Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
    Kalam was invited by <strong>Raja Ramanna </strong>to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL,
    even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant,
    which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval
    of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary
    powers under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these
    classified aerospace projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which
    prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam and
    <strong> Dr V S Arunachalam,</strong> metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by
    the then Defence Minister,<strong> R. Venkataraman </strong>on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking
    planned missiles one after another.[30] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion
    for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30]
    Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile
    and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and
    time overruns.[30][31] Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research
    and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period
    in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with
    Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's
    best known nuclear scientist.[33] However, the director of the site test,<strong> K Santhanam</strong>, said that the thermonuclear bomb had
    been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[35]
    In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, <strong>Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent,</strong> named the "Kalam-Raju Stent"
    .[36][37] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[38]<br/>
    <br/>
    <h1><i>Presidency</i></h1><br/>
    Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with
    an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002,
    to 25 July 2007.[39] On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed
    that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
    Congress Party backed his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan
    chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:<br/>
    <br/>
    On 18 June,<u>Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.</u>[46]<br/>
<br/>
    Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the
    media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was
    held on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[48] and moved into
    the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured
    with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954)
    and Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.[50]
    He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51]<br/>
<br/>
    During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,[52][53][54] saying that signing
    the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.[55][56][57] Kalam was criticised
    for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.[58]
    Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the
    death sentence of convicts on death row.[58][59] Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president,
    rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[58] Perhaps the most notable plea was from
    Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament
    and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[59] While the sentence was scheduled to be carried
    out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.[59] He also took
    the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.[60]<br/>
<br/>
    In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India,
    keeping in view the population of the country.[61][62][63][64]<br/>
<br/>
    At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided
    there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[65] However, two days later, he decided not
    to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any
    political processes.[66] He was proposed by third front named United National Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa
    and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the support
    of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.[67][68]<br/>
<br/>
    Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed
    that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71] After the reports, social networking sites
    witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed verification],
    saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed
    him for the 2012 presidential election.[74][75] A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also
    expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary
    supporter.[77] On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:<br/>
<br/>
    Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me and the
    aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I want to thank
    them for the trust they have in me.[78],<br/>
    <br/>
    Post-presidency
    After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
    the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow
    of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[79] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
    Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and
    research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology,
    Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[80]<br/>
    <br/>
    In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement,
    with a central theme of defeating corruption.[83][84]<br/>
    <br/>
    Death

    <br/>
    Kalam at Bijnor a week before his death<br/>
    On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian
    Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter
    the auditorium after a brief rest.[85] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[86][87]
    He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.
    [86] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m.
    IST.[86][88][89] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"[90]<br/>
    <br/>
    Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from
    where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam
    Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi
    Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[91]
    His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji
    Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress
    President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.[92]<br/>
    <br/>
    On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai
    in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the
    three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu,
    Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony,
    Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his
    hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station
    to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.[93][94]<br/>
    <br/>
    On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people
    attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka,
    Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.[95][96]<br/>
    <br/>
    Reactions<br/>
    India reacted to Kalam's death with an outpouring of grief; numerous tributes were paid to the former president across
    the nation and on social media.[97] The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect.
    [98] President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and other leaders condoled the former
    President's demise.[88] Prime Minister Narendra Modi said "Kalam's death is a great loss to the scientific community.
    He took India to great heights. He showed the way."[99] Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister
    under Kalam, said, "our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self-reliance in
    defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president
    of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations to come."[100] ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his
    former colleague "a great personality and a gentleman", while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as "a global leader"
    for whom "the downtrodden and poor people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to
    the young generation", adding that his death left a vacuum which none could fill.<br/>
    <br/>
    South Asian leaders expressed condolences and lauded the late statesman. The Bhutanese government ordered the country's
    flags to fly at half-staff to mourn Kalam's death and lit 1000 butter lamps in homage. Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering
    Tobgay expressed deep sadness, saying Kalam "was a leader greatly admired by all people, especially the youth of India who
    have referred to him as the people's President".[103] Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam as "a rare
    combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia" and
    termed his death an "irreparable loss to India and beyond". Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said "as a nuclear
    scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people". Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam "an
    inspirational figure to millions of people," noting that "we have a lot to learn from his life". Nepalese Prime Minister
    Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scientific contributions to India: "Nepal has lost a good friend and I have lost an honoured
    and ideal personality." The President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif also expressed
    their grief and condolences on his death.[104][105][106] The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, also expressed his
    condolences. "Dr. Kalam was a man of firm conviction and indomitable spirit, and I saw him as an outstanding statesman of the world.
    His death is an irreparable loss not only to India but to the entire world."[107] Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen and Vice-president
    Ahmed Adeeb condoled Kalam's death, with Yameen naming him as a close friend of the Maldives who would continue to be an
    inspiration to Indians and generations of South Asians. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had made an official visit to
    India during Kalam's presidency, termed his demise as a great loss to all of humankind.[108] The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar
    Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, expressed condolences on behalf of the Myanmar government.[109] The Dalai Lama expressed
    his sadness and offered condolences and prayers, calling Kalam's death "an irreparable loss".[110]<br/>
    <br/>
    Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, which Kalam had visited on numerous occasions, expressed "deepest condolences ...
    as a respected scientist, he played a critical role in the development of the Indian space programme. As a committed educator,
    he inspired millions of young people to achieve their very best. And as a devoted leader, he gained support both at home and abroad,
    becoming known as 'the people's President'. I join our Indo–Canadian families, friends, and neighbours in mourning the passing of this
    respected leader."[111] United States President Barack Obama extended "deepest condolences to the people of India on the passing of
    former Indian President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam", and highlighted his achievements as a scientist and as a statesman, notably his role in
    strengthening US–India relations and increasing space co-operation between the two nations. "Suitably named 'the People's President',
    Dr. Kalam's humility and dedication to public service served as an inspiration to millions of Indians and admirers around the world."
    [112] Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed sincere condolences and conveyed his sympathy and support "to the near and dear ones
    of the deceased leader, to the government, and entire people of India". He remarked on Kalam's outstanding "personal contribution to
    the social, economic, scientific, and technical progress of India and in ensuring its national security," adding that Kalam would be
    remembered as a "consistent exponent of closer friendly relations between our nations, who has done a lot for cementing mutually beneficial
    Russian–Indian cooperation."[113] Other international leaders—including former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
    Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh
    Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and vice-president and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and emir of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed
    bin Rashid Al Maktoum—also paid tribute to Kalam.[114][115] In a special gesture, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon
    visited the Permanent Mission of India to the UN and signed a condolence book. "The outpouring of grief around the world is a testament
    of the respect and inspiration he has garnered during and after his presidency. The UN joins the people of India in sending our deepest
    condolences for this great statesman. May he rest in peace and eternity", Ban wrote in his message.<br/>

    <h1><i>DEATH</i></h1>
   <strong On 27 July 2015,</strong> Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on<strong>"Creating a Livable Planet Earth" </strong>the Indian Institute
    of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after
    a brief rest.[85] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[86][87]<strong> He was rushed to the nearby
    Bethany Hospital in a critical condition;</strong> upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86] Despite
    being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[86][88][89]<strong> His
    last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"[90]  </strong> <br/>
       <br/>
    Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati from where it was
    flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon
    and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three
    service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[91] His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped
    with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage,
    including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh
    Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.<br/>
                <br/>
    On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai
    in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the
    three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon
    Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body
    was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram.
    Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay
    their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.<br/>
     <br/>
On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000
    people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka,
    Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
